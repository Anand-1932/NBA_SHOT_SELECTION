# NBA_SHOT_SELECTION
Shot selection is a critical factor in basketball performance, directly affecting a team's scoring efficiency and win probability. However:

Players often take suboptimal shots due to in-game pressure, poor situational awareness, or misaligned decision-making.

Coaching staff rely on post-game analysis and heuristics rather than real-time data-driven insights to guide decisions.

Advanced analytics exist but are underutilized in dynamic, real-time scenarios, limiting actionable impact during games.

These challenges result in lost scoring opportunities, lower shooting percentages, and increased turnover rates.

With use machine learning algorithm we can improve scoring efficiency, real time decision support, player development and strategic planning.

We will develope a machine learning shot selection model that evaluates the shot probablities in real time, taking into account player shooting percentages by location, defensive positioning and proximity of defenders, game context (e.g., time remaining, score differential, player fatigue) and Historical success rates of similar shot scenarios.

The model will provide a "shot quality score" or "expected points value" for each shot opportunity, accessible to coaches via a live dashboard and integrated into post-game analysis tools.

In summary investing in an ML-powered shot selection system aligns with the NBAâ€™s data-driven future. By improving scoring efficiency, enhancing player performance, and gaining a competitive edge, the project offers significant value to teams, and fans.
